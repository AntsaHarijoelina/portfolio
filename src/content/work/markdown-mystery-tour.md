## Overview

> "Commerce is not just about selling; it’s about connecting with people through products that tell a story."

La Boutique Malgache is an online platform I developed to promote handcrafted products from Madagascar. I used Symfony for server-side logic and Twig for rendering the pages. The site offers a simple and intuitive user experience, with smooth management of products, orders, and payments.

### Key Features

- **Product Management**: Adding, editing, and deleting products with categories and filtering options.
- **Shopping Cart & Checkout**: A dynamic cart system with management of quantities, discounts, and shipping fees.
- **Responsive Design**: The design is responsive, ensuring an optimal experience on all devices.
- **Security**: Implemented user management and secure payment processing.

### Technologies Used

- **Back-end**: Symfony, PHP
- **Front-end**: Twig, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Version Control**: Git

## Project Goals and Challenges

One of the main goals of this project was to create an online platform for selling handcrafted products while ensuring a seamless user experience. One of the major challenges was ensuring the site was accessible and performant, even for mobile users, while integrating advanced Symfony features.

I also focused on transaction security and user management to provide a reliable shopping experience.

### Future Improvements

This project is still in development, with several new features planned, including:

- **Recommendation System** based on users' purchase history.
- **Integration with a Shipping Service** to streamline the order fulfillment process.
- **SEO Optimization** to improve the site's visibility on search engines.
